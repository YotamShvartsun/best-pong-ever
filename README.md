# best-pong-ever
This is a school project\me creating the best pong ever!!!!
### WHAT IS THIS?
Remember the game pong? So this is pong, created with assembly (8086, 16 bit, tasm) for DOS.
### But why?
Because i want to get an A+, that's why.
### How is this gonna work?
Er, I don't know, binary? hex? things??
### will you get an A+?
I sure hope so!
### What I've got so far:
- you can control these little players and move them around
- you can draw a ball whereever you want
- actually move the ball
- count points
- get an A+
### Whats next?
- I have no idea!

### Sounds nice, can I try it?
Yes! Just clone this repo, compile the code in pong.asm and you are good to go!
